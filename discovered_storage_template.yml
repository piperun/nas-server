# 
# IMPORTANT: Review and modify this template before importing into storage_config.yml
# 
# Instructions:
# 1. Review each drive configuration below
# 2. Set appropriate mount_point for each drive
# 3. Configure encryption settings (encrypt: true/false)
# 4. Set service integration (nfs_export, samba_share)
# 5. Either copy sections to storage_config.yml or import entire file

# Discovered LUKS keyfiles configuration (add keys as needed)
